# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics often associated with matrices, vectors, and systems of linear equations (SLE).

However, linear algebra is much more than just arithmetic associated with matrices.  Linear algebra is one of the most theory rich fields of mathematics that intersects with most other fields of mathematics. Linear algebra is the study of linear spaces (vector spaces) and linear transformations.
