# Representations

You’ll often see the same set written in different ways.

## Sentence form

Describe the set in words.

Example: “The set of even integers.”

## Roster notation

List elements inside braces.

Example:

$$
A = \{2,4,6,8\}.
$$

Use $\dots$ when there’s a clear pattern:

$$
\{2,4,6,8,\dots\}.
$$

## Set-builder notation

Describe elements with a property:

$$
A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \text{ is even} \}.
$$

Another example:

$$
B = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : 1 \le n \le 5 \} = \{1,2,3,4,5\}.
$$

### “:” vs “|”

Both mean “such that”:

$$
\{x : P(x)\} \quad\text{and}\quad \{x \mid P(x)\}.
$$

## Translating between forms

Example:

Sentence: “Integers between $-2$ and $3$ inclusive.”

Roster:

$$
\{-2,-1,0,1,2,3\}.
$$

Set-builder:

$$
\{x \in \mathbb{Z} : -2 \le x \le 3\}.
$$
